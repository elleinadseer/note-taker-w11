## Description

I have been tasked to create a note taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. The application will then be deployed through Heroku.

## Development

I think more so than any other project on the bootcamp I struggled with this challenge, despite it not being a particularly taxing tax in terms of what was being asked. For some reason I really struggled with the concepts behind writing file routes and I ran into the same problem in numerous files - once I understood the concept better I was able to resolve my issues but it was frustrating to struggle with this concept that is not even that complicated. I think I let my annoyance get the better of me rather than approaching it with curiosity. I'll try to be better in future.

## Credits

I have heavily relied on information taught through the module 11 lessons of the bootcamp; copying and then editing code from the lessons of this module to fit my needs. I also depended on one-on-one advice from tutors when I struggled to understand concepts.
